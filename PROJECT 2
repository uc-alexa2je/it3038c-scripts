# Project 2

For project 2 I used the Lab 6 and updated the webserver by adding another HTML page using Node.js.  This was pushed to my Github repo and made public for anyone to view.

This code is run with Node.js and must be installed on your system with a current version to work properly.  After loading the Node.js repo, you can check for the current version with the following code.

```node --version```
Also, this has to be ran in powershell or the terminal

My code in located in the C:\it3038c-scripts\Node\Server.js file.  Navigate here and run the following code to turn on the server...
```PS C:\it3038c-scripts\Node> node Server.js```

This will turn the server on and put it in 'listening' mode.  A message will apprear stating the server in listening on port 3000.

Once here you can open a web browser and enter 'localhost:3000/sysinfo' in the address bar and the index.html page will appear.
There you will find a link that will take you to my Git repository with the uploaded script.
